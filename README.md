A weather app
https://jesusoyer.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/

## Description
 This is an application that is can check the weather in a city and will give the user a five day a forcast. This project is created to help users
 view the weather of a location that can be used for planning trips. This project taught me how to get access to data from a weather API.


## Installation

When a user opens the page they are presented with a search button with the text search city. A user then types in a city and when the search button 
is clicked they are then presented with the current weather as well as a five day forecast for the city.
